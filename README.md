Cache replacement policies decide which cache line to evict to maximize cache hit rates. Traditional heuristics (like LRU and LFU) and recent adaptive policies face challenges in accurately predicting future reuse patterns. Deep learning offers powerful sequence modeling but is expensive and complex for hardware implementation. There is a need for a hardware-friendly, accurate cache replacement policy that leverages deep learning insights for improved CPU performance.
